Welcome to my homepage! I am Yichun Zhou, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Urban Systems](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/urban-systems-phd) at New York University (NYU), within the Department of Civil and Urban Engineering, **anticipating graduation in May 2025**. I am also a Research Associate at the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Design and Urban Science ([LOUD](https://urban.shanghai.nyu.edu/)), NYU Shanghai, and a participant in the [Urban Science: Sensing, Complexity, & Informatics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/urban-science-sensing-complexity-informatics-doctoral-track) Doctoral Track at the Center for Urban Science and Progress ([CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp)).

My research lies at the intersection of urban analytics, green space planning, and human mobility. I am dedicated to advancing sustainable urban development and enhancing human well-being through data-informed strategies. My academic work has been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening*, *Applied Geography*, and other peer-reviewed journals.

I hold a Master of Science in [Management of Technology](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/management-technology-ms-campus) from NYU and a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.wku.edu/cs/) from Western Kentucky University. Before beginning my Ph.D., I gained industry experience as a Data Science and Program Management Intern at Amazon Web Services, Bosch, and Tencent.
