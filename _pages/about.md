Welcome to my homepage! I am Yichun Zhou, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Urban Systems](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/urban-systems-phd) at New York University (NYU), in the Department of Civil and Urban Engineering, **anticipating graduation in May 2025**. I am also a Research Associate at the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Design and Urban Science ([LOUD](https://urban.shanghai.nyu.edu/)), NYU Shanghai, and a participant in the [Urban Science: Sensing, Complexity, & Informatics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/urban-science-sensing-complexity-informatics-doctoral-track) Doctoral Track at the Center for Urban Science and Progress ([CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp)).

My research lies at the intersection of urban analytics, green space planning, and human mobility. I am dedicated to advancing sustainable urban development and enhancing human well-being through data-informed strategies. My academic work has been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening*, *Applied Geography*, and other peer-reviewed journals.

I hold a Master of Science in [Management of Technology](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/management-technology-ms-campus) from NYU and a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.wku.edu/cs/) from Western Kentucky University. Before beginning my Ph.D., I gained industry experience as a Data Science and Program Management Intern at Amazon Web Services, Bosch, and Tencent.


## Selected Publications

**Visitation-based classification of urban parks through mobile phone big data in Tokyo** \
Published in *Applied Geography*, 2024.  \
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-5-17-ag-visitation-based-classification) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/visitation-base%20classification.pdf)  \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2024.103300) \
*Summary:* This study introduces a novel classification of urban parks in Tokyo based on mobile phone data from 300 parks, revealing distinct park types—everyday leisure parks, social destination parks, and seasonal activity parks—each with unique visitation patterns. These findings support targeted park management strategies that align maintenance and amenities with actual usage trends, enhancing green infrastructure planning.

**Exploring environmental equity and visitation disparities in peri-urban parks: A mobile phone data-driven analysis in Tokyo** \
Published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, 2024.  \
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-4-30-lup-peri-urban-park) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf)  \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105104) \
*Summary:* This study examines environmental equity and visitation disparities in Tokyo's peri-urban parks using mobile phone data, revealing that extending the park service radius beyond 10 km could reduce inequities in park access. The findings provide insights for developing policies that enhance accessibility and better address visitor needs in urban planning.


**“Unfenced” parks and residents’ visit patterns: A regression discontinuity design in Shanghai** \
Published in <i>Urban Forestry & Urban Greening</i>, 2024.\
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-07-23-ufug-unfenced-park) \| [PDF Download](https://www.yichunzhou.com/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf) \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128459) \
*Summary:* This study employs a regression discontinuity design to examine shifts in park visitation behaviors among Shanghai residents following the sudden easing of COVID-19 containment measures, revealing decreased visits, reduced public transit use, and diminished activity levels, particularly in larger parks and community greenspaces. These insights inform greenspace management strategies during transitional post-pandemic periods.
