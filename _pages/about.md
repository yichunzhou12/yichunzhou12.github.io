Welcome to my homepage! I am Yichun Zhou, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Urban Systems](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/urban-systems-phd) at New York University (NYU) Tandon School of Engineering, in the Department of Civil and Urban Engineering. **Anticipating graduation in May 2025**, I conduct research at the intersection of urban analytics, environmental planning, and human mobility to support sustainable urban environments and enhancing human well-being through data-informed strategies. I am also a Research Associate at the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Design and Urban Science ([LOUD](https://urban.shanghai.nyu.edu/)), NYU Shanghai, and a participant in the [Urban Science: Sensing, Complexity, & Informatics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/urban-science-sensing-complexity-informatics-doctoral-track) doctoral track at the Center for Urban Science and Progress ([CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp)).

My research focuses on leveraging computational techniques—including machine learning, spatial statistics, and causal inference—to explore the role of green spaces, urban mobility, and environmental equity in fostering healthier, more inclusive cities. Utilizing spatial data from diverse sources such as mobile phone data, street view imagery, and survey, my work aims to advance data-driven policies that enhance urban well-being, accessibility to green spaces, and sustainable development. My academic work has been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening*, *Applied Geography*, and several under review at other peer-reviewed journals.

I hold a Master of Science in [Management of Technology](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/management-technology-ms-campus) with a specialization in Data Analytics from NYU and a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.wku.edu/cs/) with a Minor in Business Administration from Western Kentucky University. Before beginning my Ph.D., I gained industry experience as a Data Science and Program Management Intern at Amazon Web Services, Bosch, and Tencent.


## Selected Publications

**Visitation-based classification of urban parks through mobile phone big data in Tokyo** \
Published in *Applied Geography*, 2024.  \
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-5-17-ag-visitation-based-classification) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/visitation-base%20classification.pdf)  \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2024.103300) \
*Summary:* This study introduces a novel classification of urban parks in Tokyo based on mobile phone data from 300 parks, revealing distinct park types—everyday leisure parks, social destination parks, and seasonal activity parks—each with unique visitation patterns. These findings support targeted park management strategies that align maintenance and amenities with actual usage trends, enhancing green infrastructure planning.

**Exploring environmental equity and visitation disparities in peri-urban parks: A mobile phone data-driven analysis in Tokyo** \
Published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, 2024.  \
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-4-30-lup-peri-urban-park) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf)  \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105104) \
*Summary:* This study examines environmental equity and visitation disparities in Tokyo's peri-urban parks using mobile phone data, revealing that extending the park service radius beyond 10 km could reduce inequities in park access. The findings provide insights for developing policies that enhance accessibility and better address visitor needs in urban planning.


**“Unfenced” parks and residents’ visit patterns: A regression discontinuity design in Shanghai** \
Published in <i>Urban Forestry & Urban Greening</i>, 2024.\
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-07-23-ufug-unfenced-park) \| [PDF Download](https://www.yichunzhou.com/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf) \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128459) \
*Summary:* This study employs a regression discontinuity design to examine shifts in park visitation behaviors among Shanghai residents following the sudden easing of COVID-19 containment measures, revealing decreased visits, reduced public transit use, and diminished activity levels, particularly in larger parks and community greenspaces. These insights inform greenspace management strategies during transitional post-pandemic periods.
