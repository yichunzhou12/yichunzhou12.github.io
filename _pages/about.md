Welcome to my homepage! I am Yichun Zhou, a Postdoctoral Fellow of Urban Science at the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Design and Urban Science ([LOUD](https://urban.shanghai.nyu.edu/)), [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in [Urban Systems](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/urban-systems-phd) from the Department of Civil and Urban Engineering at New York University (NYU) Tandon School of Engineering, where I was also affiliated with the [Urban Science: Sensing, Complexity, & Informatics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/urban-science-sensing-complexity-informatics-doctoral-track) doctoral track at the Center for Urban Science and Progress ([CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp)).

My research investigates how computational and data-driven approaches can advance urban sustainability and well-being, with a particular emphasis on green space access, human mobility, environmental equity, and public health outcomes. I employ methods spanning machine learning, spatial statistics, and causal inference, drawing on large-scale spatial data sources such as mobile phone records, street view imagery, and georeferenced surveys. Through this work, I seek to generate actionable evidence that informs planning and policy interventions for more equitable and sustainable cities. My findings have been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening*, and *Applied Geography*, among others.

I hold an M.S. in [Management of Technology](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/management-technology-ms-campus) with a specialization in Data Analytics from NYU and a B.S. in [Computer Science](https://www.wku.edu/cs/) with a Minor in Business Administration from Western Kentucky University. Prior to my doctoral studies, I gained industry experience in data science and program management through positions at Amazon Web Services, Bosch, and Tencent. A full summary of my background and research is available in my [CV](Zhou_Yichun_CV.pdf).
