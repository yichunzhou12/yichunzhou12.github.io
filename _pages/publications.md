### Visitation-based classification of urban parks through mobile phone big data in Tokyo
Published in *Applied Geography*, 2024.  
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-5-17-ag-visitation-based-classification) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/visitation-base%20classification.pdf) \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2024.103300)  
**Citation:** **Zhou, Y.**, Guan, C., Wu, L., Li, Y., Nie, X., Song, J., Kim, S. K., & Akiyama, Y. (2024). Visitation-based classification of urban parks through mobile phone big data in Tokyo. *Applied Geography, 167*, 103300.  
*Summary:* This study introduces a novel classification of urban parks in Tokyo based on mobile phone data from 300 parks, revealing distinct park types—everyday leisure parks, social destination parks, and seasonal activity parks—each with unique visitation patterns. These findings support targeted park management strategies that align maintenance and amenities with actual usage trends, enhancing green infrastructure planning.

### Exploring environmental equity and visitation disparities in peri-urban parks: A mobile phone data-driven analysis in Tokyo
Published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*, 2024.  
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-4-30-lup-peri-urban-park) \| [PDF Download](http://yichunzhou12.github.io/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf) \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105104)  
**Citation:** Guan, C., & **Zhou, Y.** (2024). Exploring environmental equity and visitation disparities in peri-urban parks: A mobile phone data-driven analysis in Tokyo. *Landscape and Urban Planning, 248*, 105104.  
*Summary:* This study examines environmental equity and visitation disparities in Tokyo's peri-urban parks using mobile phone data, revealing that extending the park service radius beyond 10 km could reduce inequities in park access. The findings provide insights for developing policies that enhance accessibility and better address visitor needs in urban planning.

### “Unfenced” parks and residents’ visit patterns: A regression discontinuity design in Shanghai
Published in *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening*, 2024.  
[Read more](https://yichunzhou12.github.io/publication/2024-07-23-ufug-unfenced-park) \| [PDF Download](https://www.yichunzhou.com/files/LUP_peri%20urban%20park.pdf) \| [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128459)  
**Citation:** Wu, L., **Zhou, Y.**, Nie, X., Kim, S. K., Shao, Y., & Guan, C. (2024). “Unfenced” parks and residents’ visit patterns: A regression discontinuity design in Shanghai. *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening, 78*, 128459.  
*Summary:* This study employs a regression discontinuity design to examine shifts in park visitation behaviors among Shanghai residents following the sudden easing of COVID-19 containment measures, revealing decreased visits, reduced public transit use, and diminished activity levels, particularly in larger parks and community greenspaces. These insights inform greenspace management strategies during transitional post-pandemic periods.
